# Wikipedia Family Tree Scraper

Overview

The Wikipedia Family Tree Scraper is a Python script designed to extract and visualize family tree information from Wikipedia pages. It utilizes web scraping techniques to retrieve data about individuals, including their names, dates of birth, dates of death, and parental information. The script allows users to input a Wikipedia URL for a specific individual and then traverses through the family tree, providing details about each member along the way.

Why did I make this?
My hobbies include seeing how far back in time I can go through generations on Wikipedia. I am most interested in the lives of royal women, as they were often forced to move to a different country after being married off at a young age and often died due to childbirth at a young age.
